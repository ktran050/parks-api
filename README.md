# Purpose

This app was made to interface with the National Parks API at: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm
Users will be able to search for parks in one or more states, define a number of results to show (up to 10), and display a list of results (full name, description, website URL).
Only one set of results will be displayed per query.
